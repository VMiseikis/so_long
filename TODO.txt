Known issues:
- needs to be adapted to new, faster MLX library
- needs to be remade with frame calculated according the time, not the raw cpu power
- forgot to check map extention.
- Makefile needs rework;
- sometimes player animation stops while moving diagonally;
- Sometimes enemy at the edge of the map get stuck on map objeckts;
- Maybe needs revork of collision detection. Ex.: maybe it should detect diferent 
	sizes of collision depending on object facing direction (for ex. visually 
	player sprite is less wider then facing right or left compared to up and down).
- Needs code cleaning. Some functions are kinda dublicate. but because of shortge of time, i couldn't clean it.
- Optional. Would be nice to have: meniu, level selection, music.
- Needs more refined sprites :)
